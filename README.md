</h1>

Heya! I'm Ramin , a stdudent who is
studying Computer Engineering, currently 4th grade.
Possess strong communication skills and keen to
pursue a career in Cyber-Security and Network
Programming fields. I have been dealing with cyber
security in the last 3 years and I have tried to imporve
myself as much as possible in this field, always thirsty to learn more.
I am an active member of free online platforms for
learning cyber security, that use hands-on exercises
and labs for instance, <a href="https://tryhackme.com/xramx"> "tryhackme.com" </a>and
"hackthebox.eu". There is a lot to learn
and as I said before I am always open to learning
more.
